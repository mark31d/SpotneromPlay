## Description (3000–3500 characters) — USE THIS

Spotnerom Play is a team match simulator where you create teams, simulate matches, and compete on the leaderboard. Build your squad, train your players, and climb the ranks with every win and draw.

**HOW IT WORKS**

Create your teams in Account, give them names, and each team gets random stats for attack, defense, and form. Go to Play, pick your team and an opponent, then tap Simulate Match. The result is calculated from both teams' stats, so stronger and better-trained teams have a real advantage.

**LEADERBOARD**

Win matches and draws to climb the leaderboard and see how your teams compare. Every match counts.

**TEAM TRAINING**

Use Team Training to improve your squads. Train muscle groups (legs, core, cardio, power) to boost your team's strength. Each team has a short cooldown between sessions, so you can plan your training over time.

**MATCH STATISTICS**

After each match, see detailed stats: shots on target, possession, corners, fouls, shots, and cards. Open Match History to review any past game with full statistics and team performance.

**FEATURES**

• Create and manage multiple teams
• Simulate matches with realistic stats
